# Metis_NLP

The fourth project from my Metis Data Science Bootcamp centered around natural language processing and unnsupervised learning models.

I chose to scrape tweets from Twitter and build an unsupervised learning model to identify the primary topics that make up New Years resolutions and the general sentiment surrounding resolutions. The goal was to identify what areas of the wellness field are best promoted at this time of year so that we can help individuals improve their health and well-being.

The finalized documents include:
- A Jupyter Notebook for the minimum viable product (MVP) assignment
- Jupyter Notebooks with the code for the project (scraping tweets from Twitter)
